## Provisioning Server (pserv) configuration.

## Where to log. This log can be rotated by sending SIGUSR1 to the
## running server.
#
# logfile: "pserv.log"
logfile: "/var/log/maas/pserv.log"

## OOPS configuration (optional).
#
oops:
  ## Directory in which to place OOPS reports.  Must not contain any files
  # or directories other than what the oops machinery creates there.
  #
  # directory:
  directory: "/var/log/maas/oops"
  # reporter:
  reporter: "maas-pserv"

## Message broker configuration (optional, not currently used).
#
broker:
  # host: "localhost"
  # port: 5673
  # username: <current user>
  # password: "test"
  # vhost: "/"

## TFTP configuration.
#
tftp:
  # root: /var/lib/maas/tftp
  # port: 69
  ## The URL to be contacted to generate PXE configurations.
  # generator: http://localhost/MAAS/api/1.0/pxeconfig/

## Boot configuration.
boot:
  ## Directory containing ephemeral boot images, etc.
  #   images_directory: /var/lib/maas/ephemeral
  ## CPU architectures for which boot images should be downloaded from the
  ## server, e.g. ['i386/generic', 'amd64/generic'].  MAAS needs these images
  ## in order to boot nodes up.
  ##
  ## Leave this option out to download images for all architectures.
  #
  architectures: ['i386/generic', 'amd64/generic']

  ## Settings for ephemeral boot images.  These images are used when
  ## commissioning nodes, and during fast-path installation.
  #
  ephemeral:

    ## Directory where ephemeral boot images and related state should be
    ## stored.
    #
    #   images_directory: /var/lib/maas/ephemeral
    images_directory: /var/lib/maas/ephemeral

    ## Releases for which ephemeral images should be downloaded.
    ## These images are quite large (about a quarter GB each), so you may want
    ## to restrict these separately even if you do want the regular install
    ## images for all releases.  Leave this out to download all currently
    ## supported releases.
