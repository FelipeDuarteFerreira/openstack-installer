dependencies:
  sudo apt-get install python3-yaml python3-urwid # python3-nose for tests

To run, ensure you have a 'juju status' that will do something reasonable, and
run src/cloud-install-status.

To test, make sure you have python3-nose installed, then run:
  nosetests3
from tests/. (We can fix this to not be location dependant later on, I just
haven't bothered for now.)
