dependencies:
  sudo apt-get install python3-yaml python3-urwid # python3-nose for tests

To run, ensure you have a 'juju status' that will do something reasonable, and
run src/cloud-install-status.

To test, make sure you have python3-nose installed, then run:
  nosetests3
from tests/. (We can fix this to not be location dependant later on, I just
haven't bothered for now.)

## Building a package

python3-all python3-setuptools needed to build.

$ make deb

This will build the proper tarball and packages.

## Building the tarball only

$ make tarball

## Cleaning

$ make clean
